# Vision-Controls

# Getting Started - FRONTEND

We will be combining React and Electron for this project! To test out this repository, run these commands:

- **git clone https://github.com/aggie-coding-club/Vision-Controls.git**

    Clones git repository to your computer
    Note: run this command in directory you want to project to show up in
    
- **cd Vision-Controls**

    Travel in your terminal into whatever the repository is called - I believe it will be called ElectronAndReact

- **npm install --global yarn**
    
    Installs yarn onto your computer

- **yarn install**

    Installs all the dependencies you need to work on the project.
    
- **cd front-end**

    Travel to directory where frontend will be working in


- **yarn start** or **npm run start**

    Gets your React app up and running on  http://localhost:3000/ 

- **npm run electron-start**

    Starts up and electron and opens up an app window.\
    Note: only run this command until AFTER **yarn start** has finished running.\
      - Electron is grabbing whatever you are running on your localhost and displaying it on your Electron window.\
      - Consequences: only an empty screen will show up because it could not grab anything from the localhost

## Bundle Electron App
 
 - **cd front-end**
 - **yarn install** or **npm install**
 - **npm run preelectron-pack**
 - **npm run electron-pack**
